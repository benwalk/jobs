## Coding Questions
---

I find it helpful to practice simple programming problems on platforms like [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) and [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
when preparing for interviews, learning a new language, or just to sharpen or refresh those skills.

Here, I've documented my solutions to many of these problems, and tried to include some notes about it; if I ever encounter the need to reverse a BST or
implement a radix trie in the wild, I hope I'll have seen it and written it down here first.
